# C.L.A.R.A.

If you’re here, you probably know what this is, so I won’t bother explaining it.

## Inviting the Discord bot into your server

You can invite the Discord bot into your server using the following link: <https://wkbrl.netlify.app/clara/invite>.

## Using the code yourself

The main purposes of this repository are for transparency about how C.L.A.R.A. works and for helping others create similar applications. Since C.L.A.R.A. is free software, you are free to run it on your machine. However, the code in this repo needs some requirements to run. If you want to run C.L.A.R.A. without going through the hassle of satisfying all of them, you’ll need to edit the code yourself to remove its dependency on them. Note that I will not provide support for running this code.

**If you want to publish a bot (or any other piece of software) that includes code from this repository, you must follow the license!** This includes making the source code of your software also publicly available.
